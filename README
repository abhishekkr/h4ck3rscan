now it's 'hackers_can.hacker_scan'

+ it's a network utility which is really simple to allow even a beginner to scan particular machines for user-desired anomalies
  have an architectural concept decided for it, give it some time :)

+ developed in Ruby .....moved from Java to Ruby, don't ask why..... just because I was mad at Oracle

+ would take user desired anomalies in xml,yml formats
